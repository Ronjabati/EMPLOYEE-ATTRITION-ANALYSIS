The dataset comprised a broad spectrum of attributes concerning employees within an organization. 
My primary objectives was to classify the employee attrition rates. The project aimed its forecasting capabilities, leveraging the selected model(s), I tried predicting employee attrition. By unraveling the underlying factors contributing to attrition, the model effectively classified employees as likely to stay or leave the company based on discerned parameters. The analysis journey proceeded to data partitioning, facilitating the training of models using an array of data mining methods. These consisted of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks. Through thorough evaluation, I discerned the most fitting model(s) based on metrics such as accuracy and interpretability.
